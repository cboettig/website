## Core Infrastructure

I have been a founder and co-maintainer of The [Rocker Project](https://rocker-project.org) since 2014.
The Rocker Project provides Docker-based software stacks emphasizing reproducible research.
Our images are widely used by individual teachers and researchers, large NSF cyberinfrastructure projects such as CyVerse, and 
university teaching infrastructure (including https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu) platforms.
The Rocker Project has been identified as Essential Open Source Software by the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative.
