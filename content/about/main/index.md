  I work on problems in ecological forecasting and decision making under
  uncertainty, with applications for global change, conservation and
  natural resource management. I am particularly interested in how we can
  predict or manage ecological systems that may experience regime shifts:
  sudden and dramatic changes that challenge both our models and available
  data.  The rapid expansion in both computational power and the available
  ecological and environmental data enables and requires new mathematical,
  statistical and computational approaches to these questions. Ecology
  has much to learn about what are and are not useful from advances in
  informatics & computer science, just as it has from statistics and
  mathematics. Traditional approaches to ecological modeling and resource
  management such as stochastic dynamic systems, Bayesian inference, and
  optimal control theory must be adapted both to take advantage of all
  available data while also dealing with its imperfections. My approach
  blends ecological theory with the synthesis of heterogeneous data and
  the development of software -- a combination now recognized as data
  science.
  
  I am co-founder of the [rOpenSci project](https://ropensci.org), a senior fellow at [BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu), and a science adviser to [NCEAS](http://nceas.ucsb.edu), reflecting my interests in open science, data science, and ecoinformatics.
